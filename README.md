# Snow-Crash
A School 42 Cybersecurity project

This project is an introduction to computer security. Snow Crash will make you discover security in various sub-domains, with a developer-oriented approach. You will become familiar with several languages (ASM/perl/phpâ€¦), develop a certain logic to understand unknown programs, and become aware of problems linked to simple programming errors.

#### Goal
	Get access to flagXX account and obtain flag using getflag binary. Then use that flag to log in next level account.

The `getflag` binary is located at `/bin/getflag` and is owned by root. It has execution permissions for `Other users`.

I suppose that the `getflag` binary gives the according flag based on the **UID** of the user who executes it.
